## Back End Development and APIs

###
A stack of servers
Until this point, you've only used JavaScript on the front end to add interactivity to a page, solve algorithm challenges, or build an SPA. But JavaScript can also be used on the back end, or server, to build entire web applications.

Today, one of the popular ways to build applications is through microservices, which are small, modular applications that work together to form a larger whole.

In the Back End Development and APIs Certification, you'll learn how to write back end apps with Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). You'll also build web applications with the Express framework, and build a People Finder microservice with MongoDB and the Mongoose library.

Course:

--------------------------------   
- Managing Packages with NPM npm (Node Package Manager).
--------------------------------   
- Basic Node and Express:
  - Meet the Node console
  - Start a Working Express Server
  - Serve an HTML File.
  - Serve Static Assets.
  - Serve JSON on a Specific Route.
  - Use the .env File.
  - Implement a Root-Level Request Logger Middleware.
  - Chain Middleware to Create a Time Server.
  - Get Route Parameter Input from the Client.
  - Get Query Parameter Input from the Client.
  - Use body-parser to Parse POST Requests.
  - Get Data from POST Requests.
 --------------------------------------------   
- MongoDB and Mongoose:
  
  - Install and Set Up Mongoose
  - Create a Model
  - Create and Save a Record of a Model
  - Create Many Records with model.create()
  - Use model.find() to Search Your Database
  - Use model.findOne() to Return a Single Matching Document from Your   Database
  - Use model.findById() to Search Your Database By _id
  - Perform Classic Updates by Running Find, Edit, then Save
  - Perform New Updates on a Document Using model.findOneAndUpdate()
  - Delete One Document Using model.findByIdAndRemove
  - Delete Many Documents with model.remove()
  - Chain Search Query Helpers to Narrow Search Results.
